                    The internet, the link that connects the world that we live in today. In the current times, we are all interconnected, the world knows everything thats going on, from any place 
                    at any time. It wasn't always like that though. On January 1, 1983, ARPANET <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="_blank">(Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)</a> established a new communications protocal called Transfer
                    Control Protocal/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP). This feat in technology is often popularized as the official "birth of the internet". Though this might be the "birth" of the internet. 
                    The internet still had a lot of history that led to this point and had a lot of growing pains. The internet is the work of a multitude of STEM fields who reached achievements that no one 
                    had ever thought was possible. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="p-paragraph-1">
                    Long before any of this technology existed. A few scientists had already thought about a "wireless world communication system." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" target="_blank">Nikola Tesla</a> trifled with this idea in the early 1900s, he never
                    got to finish his work because of a mysterious lab fire on March 13th, 1895. In the 1920s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Nyquist" target="_blank">Harry Nyquiest</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Hartley" target="_blank">Ralph Hartley</a> worked on theoretical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>. Not long after, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon" target="_blank">Claude Shannon</a>,
                    developed a theoretical film to understand fundamental keys to telecommunications technology. This was one of the three fundamental developments, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#MOSFET_(MOS_transistor)" target="_blank">MOS transistor technology</a>
                    developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_M._Atalla" target="_blank">Mohamed Atalla</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawon_Kahng" target="_blank">Dawon Kahng</a>. Accompanied by the breakthrough in <a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200312/history.cfm" target="_blank">laser technology on December 1958</a>. As technology was evolving, computer communication was 
                    evolving. At this point the "point to point" communication system was limited, it had several flaws and introduced many issues with connecting respective physical networks to form one logical
                    network. 
                </p>
                <p class="p-paragraph-2">
                    Until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Davies" target="_blank">Donald Davies</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Physical_Laboratory_(United_Kingdom)" target="_blank">National Physical Laboratory, UK</a>) created a local area network based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching" target="_blank">packet switching</a>. He proposed a rapid store and forward network that dissects
                    messages (packets) into arbitrary packets, so that decisions are made per-packet. This was a big achievement that would lead to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPL_network" target="_blank">NPL network</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="_blank">ARPANET</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPL_network" target="_blank">NPL network</a>
                    was devised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Davies" target="_blank">Donald Davies</a> and his team at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Physical_Laboratory_(United_Kingdom)" target="_blank">National Physical Laboratory, UK</a>. In October 1967, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Roberts_(scientist)" target="_blank">Larry Roberts</a> presented a proposal for the "ARPA net", based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_A._Clark" target="_blank">Wesley Clarks's</a>
                    technology to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_switching" target="_blank">message switching</a> network. At the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery" target="_blank">ACM conference</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Scantlebury" target="_blank">Roger_Scantlebury</a> presented Donald Davie's technology and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran" target="_blank">Paul Baran's</a> work at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation" target="_blank">RAND</a>a. Roberts refined the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="_blank">ARPANET</a> design by integrating packet switching. This increased the communication speed from 2.4kbps to a whopping 50kbps. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPL_network" target="_blank">NPL network</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="_blank">ARPANET</a> were the first ever 
                    two networks in the whole world to employ the use of packet switching. On October 29, 1969 the first ever <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="_blank">ARPANET</a> link was established between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles" target="_blank">University of California, Los Angeles</a> and 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRI_International" target="_blank">Stanford Research Institute</a>.

                    Years after ARPA had created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite" target="_blank">TCP/IP</a> and been running. ARPA wasn't meant to run a mass communications facility, so in July 1975, they handed it to the U.S. Military. The technology would be
                    used for a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA" target="_blank">NASA's</a> projects and other government agencies. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA" target="_blank">NASA</a> eventually created NSI, the first multiprotocol wide area network. NSI connected over 20,000 scientist across the globe.
                    In 1986, the NSF created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network" target="_blank">NSFNET</a>, a 56 kbits/s backbone for supercomuting centers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network" target="_blank">NSFNET</a> also provided regional research and educational networks in the United States. During this time, 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network" target="_blank">NSFNET</a> has multiple upgrades and has multiple partnerships including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM" target="_blank">IBM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCI_Communications" target="_blank">MCI</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan">State of Michigan</a>. The term "internet" was used as a short form of "internetworking". The term was
                    use for the large and global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite" target="_blank">TCP/IP</a> network, which we now call, "the internet". In 1989 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee</a> invented not only the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server" target="_blank">web server</a>, but the first ever <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" target="_blank">web browser</a> called the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb" target="_blank">WorldWideWeb</a>. Many others were soon developed (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer" target="_blank">Internet exlporer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers" target="_blank">more</a>) which led to the prosperous boom of popularity in the 1990s.

                    As of today, the internet is the primary tool for billions of people and has changed so many peoples lives. We've allowed people to make a living off of social media platforms and more and
                    more people are discovering technology. Not only has the internet changed peoples lives, it has provided so much knowledge. Before the internet, you had to go to a library to get knowledge, 
                    and if you didn't live in a big city, you were out of luck. Because the library might not have the books you're looking for. The internet has provided people with colllege degrees, a way to
                    gain more knowlege, a way to connect with friends and family members, and even meet new people. The internet is arguably one of the biggest technological advancements of all time. 
                    It wasn't easy, it took dedication of hundreds of scientists to overcome problems and create the thing we call the Internet. Without the internet, who knows what the world would look like today.
